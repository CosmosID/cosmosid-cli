Please be advised, we recommend running Amplicon 16S workflow with a batch of sequencing data that has
been generated from the same sequencing run. Running the Amplicon 16S workflow in a group of samples
from the same sequencing run allows for more accurate error correction and denoising because it takes
advantage of the technical variability present within the sequencing run. This variability can be used
to identify and correct errors that are specific to the sequencing run, rather than errors that are
specific to individual samples. That&#39;s why running Amplicon 16S with only 1 sample may not yield
successful results.''',

databases to characterize and predict the functional potential of the underlying microbiome community.

If you are planning to run Functional 1.0 workflow for your data, please consider running Functional
2.0 since Functional 1.0 will be phased out and will be unavailable on the HUB in 6 months time.''',

MetaCyc Pathway and Gene Ontology databases to characterize and predict the functional potential of
the underlying microbiome community.
        
If you havenâ€™t chosen the sample specimen host in Step 2, please go back to Step 2 and select the
respective host for your dataset. We recommend running Functional 2.0 with Host Read Depletion step.
The only exception to this recommendation is environmental samples.''',

      workflow has been upgraded to effectively merge the sensitivity and precision of our k-mer methodology
      with our novel Probabilistic Smith-Waterman read-alignment approach. The resulting integration not only
      augments the ability to estimate taxa abundance but also enhances the classification accuracy and
      precision. Experience accurate microbiome community characterization with "Taxa-Kepler"''',
